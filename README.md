## Overview of Project
---
V. Isualize, the CEO and co-founder of PyBer, a ride-sharing app, has given Omar (our manager) and his team (us) an assignment to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Furthermore, she would like to see a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will use Pandas and Matplotlib to accomplish these tasks and summarize how the data differs by city type.

As one can tell from looking at the summary chart, rides in urban areas account for the greatest revenue from all rides based on the data provided. ($39,854.38 of $63,538.64 or 62.7%) Rides in urban cities were also more common than rides in other areas by an even greater percentage. (1,625 of 2,375 or 68.4%)  The average revenue brought in per ride and per driver in urban cities is significantly lower than that of rural and suburban cities which explains the difference despite there being more trips completed in urban cities.

An analysis of weekly trends comparing revenues by week in rural, suburban, and urban cities futher reflects that the urban cities are continuously responsible for the most revenue.

For those who prefer a visual representation, the graph further illustrates that the revenue stream is consistently led by the urban market.

### Summary
---
Based on the analysis performed, there are certainly several areas of interest that should be pointed out to Ms. Isualize.
* I would look into why there are more drivers (2,405) than rides (1,625) found in the data provided.

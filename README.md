## Overview of Project
---
V. Isualize, the CEO and co-founder of PyBer, a ride-sharing app, has given Omar (our manager) and his team (us) an assignment to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Furthermore, she would like to see a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will use Pandas and Matplotlib to accomplish these tasks and summarize how the data differs by city type.

### Summary

#### Advantages
Some advantages of refactoring code include improving the speed of the output and by streamlining the code to get rid of any unnecessary elements that may cause confusion or be misleading. Also, it could increase a programmer's productivity if they can make adjustments to a similar existing code rather than start a new one from scratch.

#### Disadvantages
On the other hand, refactoring code can be diasdavantageous if coders become to reliant on existing code thus effecting their creativity and critical thinking that might allow them to see "a new way of doing things". Also, a programmer might rely on an existing code that is ineffectice or sloppy resulting in wasting valuable time.
